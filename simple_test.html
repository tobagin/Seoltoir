        <h2>This is a test article</h2>
        <p>This is the first paragraph of the test article. It contains enough content to be detected by the reader mode algorithm.</p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph with more content to make the article substantial enough for reader mode detection.</p>
        <p>This is the third paragraph to ensure we have enough text content for the article extraction algorithm to work properly.</p>
        <p>This is the fourth paragraph to provide even more content and make sure the reader mode works correctly on this test page.</p>
