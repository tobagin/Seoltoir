Seolt√≥ir Browser

Seolt√≥ir (Irish for "Navigator" or "Sailor") is a privacy-focused web browser built with Python, GTK4, Libadwaita, and WebKit6. Our mission is to provide a fast, secure, and user-controlled browsing experience, completely free from telemetry, invasive ads, and hidden trackers.
‚ú® Features

Seolt√≥ir has evolved significantly through multiple development tiers to offer a robust and privacy-respeciting browsing experience:
üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security First

    Zero Telemetry & Data Collection: Absolutely no usage statistics, crash reports, or personal data are sent to any third party or to the browser developers. All data is stored locally.

    Advanced Ad & Tracker Blocking: Utilizes a custom parser for Adblock Plus-compatible filter lists (like EasyList and EasyPrivacy) to block ads, tracking scripts, and malicious domains. Supports online updates of filter lists.

    Enhanced Fingerprinting Resistance:

        User-Agent Spoofing: Configurable generic User-Agent strings.

        Canvas Fingerprinting Defense: Injects noise into canvas rendering to make unique fingerprinting harder.

        Font Enumeration Spoofing: Spoofs the list of fonts reported to websites.

        Hardware Concurrency Spoofing: Spoofs reported CPU core count and device memory.

        WebRTC Control: Option to disable WebRTC to prevent IP leaks.

        Referrer Policy Control: Configurable referrer header policy to limit information leakage.

        Granular Toggles: Independent controls in settings to enable/disable specific fingerprinting resistance measures.

    Comprehensive Cookie Management:

        Default to blocking third-party cookies.

        "Delete non-bookmarked cookies on close" option to automatically clear data from sites you don't explicitly trust.

        Per-site settings to view and delete cookies and other site storage (Local Storage, IndexedDB, WebSQL).

    Encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT): Supports both DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) with configurable providers for encrypted DNS queries, protecting your browsing from DNS-based snooping.

    HTTPS Everywhere: Automatically upgrades insecure HTTP connections to HTTPS based on HSTS and a rule-based enforcement mechanism for broader coverage.

    JavaScript Control: Global toggle to enable/disable JavaScript, with per-site exceptions for fine-grained control.

    Content Isolation (Containers - Initial Phase): Introduces "Container Tabs" where each container operates with a completely isolated browsing context (separate cookies, cache, local storage), preventing cross-site tracking between different containerized activities.

üåê Core Browsing & Usability

    Tabbed Browsing: Standard tabbed interface with basic management (new, close, switch).

    Session Restore: Remembers and restores all open tabs from your last browsing session.

    Navigation: Intuitive back, forward, refresh, and home buttons with dynamic sensitivity.

    Address Bar: Integrated address bar with search functionality using configurable search engines.

    Download Manager: Basic UI to monitor download progress, open downloaded files, or open their containing folders.

    Find-in-Page: Quickly search for text within the current webpage.

    Print Functionality: Print the current webpage using system print dialogs.
    
    Zoom Controls: Zoom in/out/reset functionality with visual indicator and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Plus, Ctrl+Minus, Ctrl+0).

‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Management

    Preferences Window: A comprehensive Libadwaita-designed settings dialog for all privacy, security, and general configurations.

    Per-Site Settings Dialog: A dedicated dialog to manage JavaScript policy and site data for the currently viewed website.

    History Management: View and clear your local browsing history.

    Bookmark Management: Add, view, and remove local bookmarks.

    Search Engine Management: Full UI in preferences to add, edit, delete, and set default custom search engines with OpenSearch support and real-time search suggestions.

    Appearance Customization: Control default font family and size for web content, and override system theme with light/dark mode.

    Data Import/Export: Export and import your bookmarks, history, and browser settings (to/from JSON/CSV/HTML formats).

    In-App Notifications: Subtle toast notifications for privacy events like blocked ads/trackers.

üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

Seolt√≥ir is built with the Meson build system and designed for Flatpak distribution.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.10+

    GTK 4 development libraries

    Libadwaita development libraries

    WebKitGTK 6.0 development libraries

    Meson build system

    Ninja build system

    python-abp library (install via pip install python-abp)

    requests library (install via pip install requests)

Building from Source

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tobagin/seoltoir.git # (Assuming this is your repo URL)
    cd seoltoir

    Install Python dependencies:

    pip install requests python-abp

    (Note: For Flatpak builds, these dependencies will be handled by the Flatpak manifest.)

    Configure the Meson build:

    meson setup build --prefix=/usr

    Compile the project:

    meson compile -C build

    Install GSettings schema (important for settings to appear):

    sudo meson install -C build
    glib-compile-schemas ~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/ # Or the system path if installed globally

    Run the application:

    meson run -C build seoltoir

Flatpak Distribution

Seolt√≥ir is packaged as a Flatpak for easy distribution and sandboxing.

    Build the Flatpak:

    flatpak-builder --force-clean build-dir packaging/io.github.tobagin.seoltoir-local.yml

    Install the Flatpak to your local user repository:

    flatpak-builder --user --install build-dir packaging/io.github.tobagin.seoltoir-local.yml

    Run the Flatpak application:

    flatpak run io.github.tobagin.seoltoir

üìú License

Seolt√≥ir is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 or later. See the LICENSE file for more details.

## Flatpak Manifest Naming

Flatpak manifests now use the `.yml` extension (not `.yaml`) for consistency and clarity. Please use `packaging/io.github.tobagin.seoltoir-local.yml` for local builds and `packaging/io.github.tobagin.seoltoir.yml` for release builds.

## App ID and Icon Naming

The application ID and all icon/file references have been standardized to lowercase: `io.github.tobagin.seoltoir`. All files and references previously using `Seoltoir` have been renamed to `seoltoir` for consistency.

## Meson for Flatpak

Flatpak manifests are configured to use Meson as the build system. The app and all icons are installed via Meson, ensuring correct installation paths and integration.

## Summary of Recent Changes

- All app icon sizes (1024x1024, 512x512, 256x256, 64x64, 48x48, 32x32, 24x24, 16x16) are now generated and installed.
- The app ID and all file references are now lowercase (`io.github.tobagin.seoltoir`).
- Flatpak manifests use `.yml` extension and GNOME runtime 48.
- Meson build updated to install all icon sizes.
- All relevant files and manifests updated for new app ID and icon naming.
- Documentation updated to reflect these changes.
